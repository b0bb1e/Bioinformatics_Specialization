# Bioinformatics_Specialization
Files created for the bioinformatics specialization from UCSD on Coursera

I treated this class as a way to learn good coding practices. Thus, as I worked my way through the classes, my code documentation and style improved. There are many comments here (too many DRYs, in particular) that are unneeded and left-over from when I was debugging. Even in the later classes :)
